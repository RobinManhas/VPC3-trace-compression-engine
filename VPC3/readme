This Project is developed by below three team members:
Shweta Sahu (111481846)
Harsh Gupta (111470974)
Robin Manhas (111463105)

The project contains following two APIs.

*********** Function to encode and compress a file
/// \param input_file  FILE to encode and compress
/// \param cfgFile   configuration file, where the type of input and predictors used etc. is defined
/// \param output_path location where compressed streams(stream0, stream1.... ) to be saved
int compress(FILE *input_file, string cfgFile, string output_path);



************Function to decompress and decode the compressed streams (compression must be done using VPC3 itself)
/// \param path location where streams are stored, which has to be decompressed(where stream0, stream1.... are saved)
/// \param cfgFile configuration file, where the type of input and predictors used etc. is defined
/// \param output_file the full filename where the output will be saved
int decompress(string path, string cfgFile, char *output_file);

The config file format is as below:
<size>-Bit Field <Number> = {L2 = <secondlevelTable size>:<comma separated list of predictors;

- each line in config file corresponds to a single field in input file


example1:
If input file contains single field of 64 bit each:

64-Bit Field 1 = {L2 = 131072:FCM1[2],FCM3[2]};

example 2:
If input file contains entries comprising two fields, first of 32 bit and second of 64 bit
32-Bit Field 1 = {L2 = 131072:FCM1[2],FCM3[2]};
64-Bit Field 2 = {L2 = 131072:LV[4],FCM3[2],DFCM1[2], DFCM3[2]};

main.cpp contains the sample code to use this project to compress and decompress files.
